#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Script that installs NGINX on remote server listening to port 80
#
# REQUIREMENTS
#   Install nginx on your web-01
#   server
#   Nginx should be listening on port 80
#   When querying Nginx at its root / with a 
#       GET request (requesting a page) using curl,
#       it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
#   As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new
#       Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
#       (this script will be run on the server itself)
#   You canâ€™t use systemctl for restarting nginx
